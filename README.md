# Introduction

My name is Nathan Esquenazi and I am a developer that likes building products, 
participating in startups and the ideals of entrepreneurship. I love open source,
web development, and executing ideas. I am 25 as of the time of writing in 2012. 
Currently living in San Francisco and working as one of the first engineers at [Miso](http://gomiso.com).

**Note:** Skip my detailed story below and 
jump to [Professional History](#my-professional-history)
for summaries to skim.

# My Story

Prior to Miso, I have a history of working at startups. I have been doing so since I started
my first company [iPodSoft] as a junior in high school in 2004. I collaborated with a few 
other developers and established the brand and marketplace for selling iPod-related software. 
At iPodSoft, I developed multiple desktop and mobile softwares
before the iPod had any connection to the internet. 

## iStory Creator

My favorite project I created was 
called [iStory Creator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IStory), an interactive
storytelling mechanism for the iPod. I collected over 150 "iStories" from many authors
that would publish iStories on our website.

## Talking Panda

Shortly after I graduated high school in 2005, I was contacted by Jordan Allen-Dutton
be he wanted to acquire my software and hire me as the principal engineer to work at his startup 
[Talking Panda](http://www.talkingpanda.com/index.html). He liked building
iPod software like me and we shared a vision of the future for an iPod filled
with interactive experiences, user created software and games. 

With Talking Panda, I built a successor to iStory Creator called 
[iWriter](http://talkingpanda.com/iwriter) and worked on all the software we released. 
Our boxed software such as [iRocker](http://talkingpanda.com/irocker.php) were some of the third-party
software sold in official Apple retail stores. 

## Mogopop

We also worked together towards a vision of a 'Online Software Store' for the iPod called 
[mogopop](http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/reviews/entry/mogopop-inc-mogopopcom-beta/). 
We even spoke to Apple and met with several senior people demonstrating the power
of the iPod with third-party software available online. Little did we know
that not 6 months later, Apple would release their first iPhone and the app store.

## College Life

While I was a freshman in college at University of California at Irvine, I moved on from my first startup but 
I was hooked and began independently learning all about desktop, mobile and
web development. Executing products was fun and I realized this was
what I wanted to do...at least for a while. 

Classes and the academic theory were interesting to me but I couldn't resist the startup world.
Still, I found at that time a passion for educating others. I became a tutor for several years
teaching CS fundamentals to freshman and sophomores. I also enjoyed helping
others in my classes newer to academic computer science having
myself entered college with 3 years of CS fundamentals and a 5 on the AP test
with the help and guidance of [Bob Franz](http://www.lasv.org/laaefamily/advisors/rfranz.htm).

I did various contracting jobs, explored multiple stacks and worked for several more startups including 
[quub](http://techcrunch.com/2009/04/27/quub-a-micromessaging-service-that-asks-what-are-you-doing-and-means-it/)
working alongside one of my best professors from college.

## Olepta

In college, I started one company with my good friend Thomas Shafer called "Olepta",
which was intended to be a turnkey scheduling solutions for health professionals. 
We worked on that together for several years while in college, including coordinating with our professors
to allow us to get formal school credit for our work and turn our company into our senior class project.
Had a great time with Olepta and we ended up getting multiple patents several of which 
were ultimately acquired by [Ethicon-Endo](http://www.ees.com/).

## Graduation and Open Source

My senior year (in 2008), I was working with my professor on a startup called 'quub', my own 
startup 'Olepta' and began falling in love with web development and working more seriously with Ruby. 
I started playing with Rails and Sinatra and liking them both quite a bit. Started
doing all of my work with that stack, opting to specialize rather than explore breadth-first
as I had done before. Around this time, I began releasing 
[several](https://github.com/nesquena/wikipedia_search) [few](https://github.com/nesquena/prototype_notifier)
[early](https://github.com/nesquena/conditions_fu) [projects](https://github.com/nesquena/prototype_animator)
which sparked my interest in contributing to the open-source community.

## Post-graduation

In 2009, I graduated with a Bachelor's in "Informatics" from University of California at Irvine.
I also began working with a classmate [Arthur Chiu](https://github.com/achiu) and
started looking even closer at [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com), a ruby web micro-framework.
We began building tools for Sinatra to make web development easier and more powerful
and ultimately I released this open-source in a project called 
[sinatra-more](https://github.com/nesquena/sinatra_more). After a few months,
and multiple core contributors later, this turned into [Padrino](http://padrinorb.com/), 
the "godfather of Sinatra".

## In Closing

For the duration of my 4 years as an undergraduate, I was working in startups and contracting 
with near full-time hours. I worked in desktop development (Java, .NET),
mobile development (Blackberry, Symbian, Android) and a ton of web development (ASP.NET, Java, PHP and Ruby).
Always focused on building things and learning more about all the many, many things I didn't know. 

# My Professional History

The following is an incomplete list of a few highlights of my work history:

 * **iPodSoft** (2004) - Created my company to sell iPod-related software with other developers.
 * **Talking Panda** (2005-2007) - Worked intermittently as principal engineer on multiple iPod-related products available in Apple retail stores.
 * **Alturn Solutions** (2007-2009) - Worked intermittently to found this company with Thomas Shafer, building appointment scheduling for health professionals.
 * **quub** (2007-2010) - Worked as the principal engineer with founders to execute the vision for a passive, smart way to share your life with friends and family.

# My Skills

When I have been in a position to help grow the team in the startups I have worked at,
I always put a lot of emphasis on understanding how much visibility potential hires
have into the depths of their own skills. I consider people that rank themselves
too highly on a given skill to be a red flag of sorts. In my experience so far with development, 
the [Dunningâ€“Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
_very_ rarely gets contradicted.

I figure it is only fair to rank my own abilities on a few key skills _as they stand today_. 
I am going for complete honesty here...an attempt to honestly rate my own skills (as hard as that is).
The scale is from 1 (complete beginner, barely played with the skill) to 10 (practical master).
 
 * **Sinatra/Padrino**: 8
 * **Ruby**: 7
 * **Ruby on Rails**: 6
 * **API Development**: 6
 * **MiniTest** (unit tests): 6
 * **jQuery**: 6
 * **git**: 6
 * **Agile Process**: 5
 * **Capybara** (integration tests): 5
 * **PostgreSQL**: 5
 * **HTML5/CSS3**: 5
 * **Javascript** (no framework): 4
 * **Interaction Design** (user experience): 4
 * **Python**: 3
 * **Backbone**: 2
 * **Visual Design** (colors, layouts): 2
 * **VIM**: 1
