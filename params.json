I love open source,\r\nweb development, and executing ideas. I am 25 as of the time of writing in 2012. \r\nCurrently living in San Francisco and working as one of the first engineers at [Miso](http://gomiso.com).\r\n\r\n**Note:** Skip my detailed story below and \r\njump to [Professional History](#my-professional-history)\r\nfor summaries to skim.\r\n\r\n# My Story\r\n\r\nPrior to Miso, I have a history of working at startups. I have been doing so since I started\r\nmy first company [iPodSoft] as a junior in high school in 2004. I collaborated with a few \r\nother developers and established the brand and marketplace for selling iPod-related software. \r\nAt iPodSoft, I developed multiple desktop and mobile softwares\r\nbefore the iPod had any connection to the internet. \r\n\r\n## iStory Creator\r\n\r\nMy favorite project I created was \r\ncalled [iStory Creator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IStory), an interactive\r\nstorytelling mechanism for the iPod. I collected over 150 \"iStories\" from many authors\r\nthat would publish iStories on our website.\r\n\r\n## Talking Panda\r\n\r\nShortly after I graduated high school in 2005, I was contacted by Jordan Allen-Dutton\r\nbe he wanted to acquire my software and hire me as the principal engineer to work at his startup \r\n[Talking Panda](http://www.talkingpanda.com/index.html). He liked building\r\niPod software like me and we shared a vision of the future for an iPod filled\r\nwith interactive experiences, user created software and games. \r\n\r\nWith Talking Panda, I built a successor to iStory Creator called \r\n[iWriter](http://talkingpanda.com/iwriter) and worked on all the software we released. \r\nOur boxed software such as [iRocker](http://talkingpanda.com/irocker.php) were some of the third-party\r\nsoftware sold in official Apple retail stores. \r\n\r\n## Mogopop\r\n\r\nWe also worked together towards a vision of a 'Online Software Store' for the iPod called \r\n[mogopop](http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/reviews/entry/mogopop-inc-mogopopcom-beta/). \r\nWe even spoke to Apple and met with several senior people demonstrating the power\r\nof the iPod with third-party software available online. Little did we know\r\nthat not 6 months later, Apple would release their first iPhone and the app store.\r\n\r\n## College Life\r\n\r\nWhile I was a freshman in college at University of California at Irvine, I moved on from my first startup but \r\nI was hooked and began independently learning all about desktop, mobile and\r\nweb development. Executing products was fun and I realized this was\r\nwhat I wanted to do...at least for a while. \r\n\r\nClasses and the academic theory were interesting to me but I couldn't resist the startup world.\r\nStill, I found at that time a passion for educating others. I became a tutor for several years\r\nteaching CS fundamentals to freshman and sophomores. I also enjoyed helping\r\nothers in my classes newer to academic computer science having\r\nmyself entered college with 3 years of CS fundamentals and a 5 on the AP test\r\nwith the help and guidance of [Bob Franz](http://www.lasv.org/laaefamily/advisors/rfranz.htm).\r\n\r\nI did various contracting jobs, explored multiple stacks and worked for several more startups including \r\n[quub](http://techcrunch.com/2009/04/27/quub-a-micromessaging-service-that-asks-what-are-you-doing-and-means-it/)\r\nworking alongside one of my best professors from college.\r\n\r\n## Olepta\r\n\r\nIn college, I started one company with my good friend Thomas Shafer called \"Olepta\",\r\nwhich was intended to be a turnkey scheduling solutions for health professionals. \r\nWe worked on that together for several years while in college, including coordinating with our professors\r\nto allow us to get formal school credit for our work and turn our company into our senior class project.\r\nHad a great time with Olepta and we ended up getting multiple patents several of which \r\nwere ultimately acquired by [Ethicon-Endo](http://www.ees.com/).\r\n\r\n## Graduation and Open Source\r\n\r\nMy senior year (in 2008), I was working with my professor on a startup called 'quub', my own \r\nstartup 'Olepta' and began falling in love with web development and working more seriously with Ruby. \r\nI started playing with Rails and Sinatra and liking them both quite a bit. Started\r\ndoing all of my work with that stack, opting to specialize rather than explore breadth-first\r\nas I had done before. Around this time, I began releasing \r\n[several](https://github.com/nesquena/wikipedia_search) [few](https://github.com/nesquena/prototype_notifier)\r\n[early](https://github.com/nesquena/conditions_fu) [projects](https://github.com/nesquena/prototype_animator)\r\nwhich sparked my interest in contributing to the open-source community.\r\n\r\n## Post-graduation\r\n\r\nIn 2009, I graduated with a Bachelor's in \"Informatics\" from University of California at Irvine.\r\nI also began working with a classmate [Arthur Chiu](https://github.com/achiu) and\r\nstarted looking even closer at [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com), a ruby web micro-framework.\r\nWe began building tools for Sinatra to make web development easier and more powerful\r\nand ultimately I released this open-source in a project called \r\n[sinatra-more](https://github.com/nesquena/sinatra_more). After a few months,\r\nand multiple core contributors later, this turned into [Padrino](http://padrinorb.com/), \r\nthe \"godfather of Sinatra\".\r\n\r\n## In Closing\r\n\r\nFor the duration of my 4 years as an undergraduate, I was working in startups and contracting \r\nwith near full-time hours. I worked in desktop development (Java, .NET),\r\nmobile development (Blackberry, Symbian, Android) and a ton of web development (ASP.NET, Java, PHP and Ruby).\r\nAlways focused on building things and learning more about all the many, many things I didn't know. \r\n\r\n# My Professional History\r\n\r\nThe following is an incomplete list of a few highlights of my work history:\r\n\r\n * **iPodSoft** (2004) - Created my company to sell iPod-related software with other developers.\r\n * **Talking Panda** (2005-2007) - Worked intermittently as principal engineer on multiple iPod-related products available in Apple retail stores.\r\n * **Alturn Solutions** (2007-2009) - Worked intermittently to found this company with Thomas Shafer, building appointment scheduling for health professionals.\r\n * **quub** (2007-2010) - Worked as the principal engineer with founders to execute the vision for a passive, smart way to share your life with friends and family.\r\n\r\n# My Skills\r\n\r\nWhen I have been in a position to help grow the team in the startups I have worked at,\r\nI always put a lot of emphasis on understanding how much visibility potential hires\r\nhave into the depths of their own skills. I consider people that rank themselves\r\ntoo highly on a given skill to be a red flag of sorts. In my experience so far with development, \r\nthe [Dunningâ€“Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)\r\n_very_ rarely gets contradicted.\r\n\r\nI figure it is only fair to rank my own abilities on a few key skills _as they stand today_. \r\nI am going for complete honesty here...an attempt to honestly rate my own skills (as hard as that is).\r\nThe scale is from 1 (complete beginner, barely played with the skill) to 10 (practical master).\r\n \r\n * **Sinatra/Padrino**: 8\r\n * **Ruby**: 7\r\n * **Ruby on Rails**: 6\r\n * **API Development**: 6\r\n * **MiniTest** (unit tests): 6\r\n * **jQuery**: 6\r\n * **git**: 6\r\n * **Agile Process**: 5\r\n * **Capybara** (integration tests): 5\r\n * **PostgreSQL**: 5\r\n * **HTML5/CSS3**: 5\r\n * **Javascript** (no framework): 4\r\n * **Interaction Design** (user experience): 4\r\n * **Python**: 3\r\n * **Backbone**: 2\r\n * **Visual Design** (colors, layouts): 2\r\n * **VIM**: 1\r\n\r\n# My Projects\r\n\r\nFew highlights of projects I have worked on and/or created (in no particular order):\r\n\r\n| Project | Description                                                                 |\r\n| ------- | -------------------------------                                            |\r\n| [sinatra-more](https://github.com/nesquena/sinatra_more) | Powerful extensions to Sinatra | \r\n| [Padrino](http://padrinorb.com) | Alternative to Rails, elegant Ruby web framework. |\r\n| [RABL](https://github.com/nesquena/rabl) | Ruby templating for APIs |\r\n| [gitdocs](https://github.com/bazaarlabs/gitdocs) | DIY Dropbox for Developers |\r\n| [backburner](https://github.com/nesquena/backburner) | Reliable and simple ruby job queue |\r\n| [sheet_mapper](https://github.com/nesquena/sheet_mapper) | Simple ORM for google spreadsheets |\r\n| [query_reviewer](https://github.com/nesquena/query_reviewer) | Powerful DB analyzer.
