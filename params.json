I also have a passion for open source,\r\nweb development, and executing new ideas. I am 25 as of the time of writing in 2012. \r\nCurrently living in San Francisco and working as one of the first engineers at [Miso](http://gomiso.com).\r\n\r\n**Note:** Skip my detailed story below and \r\njump to my [Professional History](#my-professional-history)\r\nfor if you are in a hurry. \r\n\r\n# My Story\r\n\r\nPrior to working at Miso, I have a history of working at early-stage startups. \r\nI have been doing this since 2004, when I started my first company \r\n[iPodSoft](http://www.ipodsoft.com/site/pmwiki.php) in my 3rd year of high school. \r\nI reached out to a few other developers and established a marketplace for selling iPod-related software. \r\nWith iPodSoft, I developed and sold multiple desktop and mobile softwares \r\nbefore the iPod had any connection to the internet. \r\n\r\n## iStory Creator\r\n\r\nMy favorite project I created with iPodSoft was \r\ncalled [iStory Creator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IStory), an interactive\r\nstorytelling mechanism for the iPod using the \"Notes\" features. I had\r\ndiscovered that I could 'hack' the iPod Notes application\r\nto allow me to create HTML hyperlinks and insert music. \r\n\r\nI [created a freeware software](http://forums.ilounge.com/ipod-classic-legacy-ipods/21018-interactive-games-istory-creator.html) \r\nto allow anyone to leverage this hyperlinking feature and\r\npublish interactive stories that could be downloaded onto the iPod. \r\nI collected 150+ \"iStories\" on a variety of topics \r\nfrom many authors that I would make available for download on our website.\r\n\r\n## Talking Panda\r\n\r\nShortly after I graduated high school in 2005, I was contacted by Jordan Allen-Dutton\r\nbecause he wanted to acquire my software and hire me as the principal engineer to work at his startup \r\n[Talking Panda](http://www.talkingpanda.com/index.html). He also loved building\r\niPod software and we shared a vision of the future for an iPod filled\r\nwith interactive experiences and third-party developer-created applications. \r\n\r\nWith Talking Panda, I built the successor to iStory Creator which we branded \r\n[iWriter](http://talkingpanda.com/iwriter) and worked on several other related products. \r\niWriter was intended to be used as an educational and entertainment platform and\r\nwas experimented with by a few forward-thinking\r\nuniversities including [Penn State](http://ets.tlt.psu.edu/white-papers/iwriter-hot-team-results/).\r\nOur other educational software such as [iRocker](http://talkingpanda.com/irocker.php) became the \r\n[first third-party](http://www.macnn.com/reviews/ibar-and-irocker.html)\r\niPod software sold in official Apple retail stores. \r\n\r\n## Mogopop\r\n\r\nWe also worked together at Talking Panda towards a shared vision of an 'Online Software Store' \r\nfor the iPod called [mogopop](http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/reviews/entry/mogopop-inc-mogopopcom-beta/). \r\nWe even spoke to Apple and met with several senior executives demonstrating the power\r\nof the iPod with third-party software available online for education and entertainment. \r\nLittle did we know when they seemed both interested and surprised\r\nthat not 6 months later, Apple would release the first iPhone and the app store.\r\n\r\n## College Life\r\n\r\nWhile I was a freshman in college at University of California at Irvine, I moved on \r\nfrom my first startup but I was hooked and began independently learning all about desktop, mobile and\r\nweb development. Executing products was fun and I realized this was\r\nwhat I wanted to invest my time into. \r\n\r\nClasses and the academic theory were interesting to me but I couldn't resist my interest in startups.\r\nStill, I found at that time a passion for education and curriculum. I became a tutor for several years\r\nteaching CS fundamentals to freshman and sophomores. I also enjoyed helping\r\nother classmates understand material having\r\nmyself entered college with 3 years of CS fundamentals and a 5 on the AP test\r\nwith the guidance of my high school teacher\r\n[Bob Franz](http://www.lasv.org/laaefamily/advisors/rfranz.htm).\r\n\r\nWhile I was in college, I was always working in the industry as well.\r\nI did various freelancing jobs, explored multiple stacks and worked for several startups. This included my work with\r\n[quub](http://techcrunch.com/2009/04/27/quub-a-micromessaging-service-that-asks-what-are-you-doing-and-means-it/)\r\nwhere I had the opportunity to work with one of my best professors from college, \r\n[Don Patterson](http://www.ics.uci.edu/faculty/profiles/view_faculty.php?ucinetid=djpatter).\r\n\r\n## Olepta\r\n\r\nIn college, I started a company with my good friend [Thomas Shafer](https://github.com/growlypants) \r\nnamed Olepta, which was a turnkey scheduling solution for health professionals. \r\nWe worked on that together for several years while in college, including coordinating with our professors\r\nto allow us to get formal school credit for our work and turn our company into our senior class project.\r\nWe also applied to several business competitions on campus and got awarded prize money we used to\r\nfund the operations of our small startup. Had a great time with Olepta and we ended up \r\ngetting multiple patents several of which were ultimately acquired by [Ethicon-Endo](http://www.ees.com/).\r\n\r\n## Graduation and Open Source\r\n\r\nMy senior year (in 2008), I was working with my professor on a startup called 'quub', my own \r\nstartup we called Olepta and began falling in love with web development and working more seriously with Ruby. \r\nI started playing much more seriously with Rails and Sinatra and liking them both quite a bit. Started\r\nfocusing all of my time into that stack, opting to specialize rather than explore breadth-first\r\nas I had been doing. Around this time, I decided to\r\n[release](https://github.com/nesquena/wikipedia_search) a [few](https://github.com/nesquena/prototype_notifier)\r\n[simple](https://github.com/nesquena/conditions_fu) [projects](https://github.com/nesquena/prototype_animator)\r\nwhich sparked my interest in the open-source community.\r\n\r\n## Post-graduation\r\n\r\nIn 2009, I graduated with a Bachelor's in \"Informatics\" from University of California at Irvine.\r\nI also began working with a classmate [Arthur Chiu](https://github.com/achiu) and\r\nstarted looking even closer at [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com), a ruby web micro-framework.\r\nWe began building tools for Sinatra to make web development easier and more powerful\r\nand ultimately I released this open-source in a project called \r\n[sinatra-more](https://github.com/nesquena/sinatra_more). After a few months,\r\nand multiple core contributors later, this quickly evolved into [Padrino](http://padrinorb.com/), \r\nthe \"godfather of Sinatra\" which is \r\n[still being used](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/wiki/Projects-using-Padrino) \r\ntoday by many developers. Our team is still actively developing Padrino and\r\nwe are working towards a stable 1.0 release.\r\n\r\n## Wrapping Up\r\n\r\nFor the duration of my 4 years as an undergraduate, I was working in startups and contracting \r\nwith near full-time hours. I worked in desktop development (Java, .NET),\r\nmobile development (Blackberry, Symbian, Android) and a ton of web development (ASP.NET, Java, PHP and Ruby).\r\nAlways focused on building things and learning more about all the many, many things I didn't know. \r\n\r\n# My Professional History\r\n\r\nThe following is an **incomplete list** of a few highlights from my work history:\r\n \r\n * **Miso** (2010-Present) - Principal engineer working closely with founders to execute multiple iterations of our vision for social TV.\r\n * **quub** (2007-2010) - Principal engineer working with founders to execute the vision for a passive, fun way to share your life with friends and family.\r\n * **Alturn Solutions** (2007-2009) - Founded this company with Thomas Shafer, building appointment scheduling for health professionals.\r\n * **Talking Panda** (2005-2007) - Principal engineer on multiple iPod-related products available in Apple retail stores.\r\n * **iPodSoft** (2003-2005) - Founded to sell iPod-related software with several other developers.\r\n \r\n# My Skills\r\n\r\nWhenever I have been in a position to help grow the team for the startups I have worked at,\r\nI put a lot of emphasis on understanding how much visibility potential hires\r\nhad into the depths of their own knowledge. I consider people that rank themselves\r\nsuspiciously high on any given skill to mark a \"red flag\" of sorts. In my experience so far, there\r\nare very few exceptions to the \r\n[Dunningâ€“Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).\r\n\r\nI figure then that it would only be fair for me to rank my own abilities on a few key skills \r\n_as they stand today_. I am going for accuracy here. An attempt to honestly \r\nevaluate my own skills (as hard as that can be).\r\nThe scale is from 1 (complete beginner, barely played with the skill) to \r\n10 (practical master, knows topic inside and out).\r\n \r\n * **Sinatra/Padrino**: 8\r\n * **Ruby**: 7\r\n * **Ruby on Rails**: 6\r\n * **API Development**: 6\r\n * **MiniTest** (unit tests): 6\r\n * **jQuery**: 6\r\n * **git**: 6\r\n * **Writing (documentation)**: 6\r\n * **Agile Process**: 5\r\n * **Capybara** (integration tests): 5\r\n * **PostgreSQL**: 5\r\n * **HTML5/CSS3**: 5\r\n * **Javascript** (no framework): 4\r\n * **Interaction Design** (user experience): 4\r\n * **Python**: 3\r\n * **Backbone**: 2\r\n * **Visual Design** (colors, layouts): 2\r\n * **VIM**: 1\r\n\r\nI will be adding to this list and hopefully updating it in an ongoing effort to improve.\r\n\r\n# My Projects\r\n\r\nA few highlights of projects I have created and/or worked on (in no particular order):\r\n\r\n| Project | Description                                                                 |\r\n| ------- | -------------------------------                                            |\r\n| [sinatra-more](https://github.com/nesquena/sinatra_more) | Powerful extensions to Sinatra | \r\n| [Padrino](http://padrinorb.com) | Alternative to Rails, elegant Ruby web framework. |\r\n| [RABL](https://github.com/nesquena/rabl) | Ruby templating for APIs |\r\n| [gitdocs](https://github.com/bazaarlabs/gitdocs) | DIY Dropbox for Developers |\r\n| [backburner](https://github.com/nesquena/backburner) | Reliable and simple ruby job queue |\r\n| [sheet_mapper](https://github.com/nesquena/sheet_mapper) | Simple ORM for google spreadsheets |\r\n| [query_reviewer](https://github.com/nesquena/query_reviewer) | Powerful DB analyzer.

I always put a lot\r\nof emphasis on documentation and making it easy for developers to get started.\r\nI also do my best to do proper unit-testing where appropriate to ensure the correctness\r\nof my projects.\r\n\r\n# Links\r\n\r\n* [Github](https://github.com/nesquena)\r\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nesquena)\r\n* [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/nathan-esquenazi/7/537/aa6)","name":"Resume","google":""}
