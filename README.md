# Introduction

My name is Nathan Esquenazi and I am a developer that likes building products, 
participating in startups and the ideals of entrepreneurship. I also have a passion for open source,
web development, and executing new ideas. I am 25 as of the time of writing in 2012. 
Currently living in San Francisco and working as one of the first engineers at [Miso](http://gomiso.com).

**Note:** Skip my detailed story below and 
jump to my [Professional History](#my-professional-history)
for if you are in a hurry. 

# My Story

Prior to working at Miso, I have a history of working at early-stage startups. 
I have been doing this since 2004, when I started my first company 
[iPodSoft](http://www.ipodsoft.com/site/pmwiki.php) in my 3rd year of high school. 
I reached out to a few other developers and established a marketplace for selling iPod-related software. 
With iPodSoft, I developed and sold multiple desktop and mobile softwares 
before the iPod had any connection to the internet. 

## iStory Creator

My favorite project I created with iPodSoft was 
called [iStory Creator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IStory), an interactive
storytelling mechanism for the iPod using the "Notes" features. I had
discovered that I could 'hack' the iPod Notes application
to allow me to create HTML hyperlinks and insert music. 

I created a freeware software to allow anyone of any technical expertise to leverage this feature and
publish interactive stories that could be downloaded onto the iPod. 
I collected 150+ "iStories" on a variety of topics 
from many authors that I would make available for download on our website.

## Talking Panda

Shortly after I graduated high school in 2005, I was contacted by Jordan Allen-Dutton
because he wanted to acquire my software and hire me as the principal engineer to work at his startup 
[Talking Panda](http://www.talkingpanda.com/index.html). He also loved building
iPod software and we shared a vision of the future for an iPod filled
with interactive experiences and third-party developer-created applications. 

With Talking Panda, I built the successor to iStory Creator which we branded 
[iWriter](http://talkingpanda.com/iwriter) and worked on several other related products. 
iWriter was intended to be used as an educational and entertainment platform and
was experimented with by a few forward-thinking
universities including [Penn State](http://ets.tlt.psu.edu/white-papers/iwriter-hot-team-results/).
Our other educational software such as [iRocker](http://talkingpanda.com/irocker.php) became the 
[first third-party](http://www.macnn.com/reviews/ibar-and-irocker.html)
iPod software sold in official Apple retail stores. 

## Mogopop

We also worked together at Talking Panda towards a shared vision of an 'Online Software Store' 
for the iPod called [mogopop](http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/reviews/entry/mogopop-inc-mogopopcom-beta/). 
We even spoke to Apple and met with several senior executives demonstrating the power
of the iPod with third-party software available online for education and entertainment. 
Little did we know when they seemed both interested and surprised
that not 6 months later, Apple would release the first iPhone and the app store.

## College Life

While I was a freshman in college at University of California at Irvine, I moved on 
from my first startup but I was hooked and began independently learning all about desktop, mobile and
web development. Executing products was fun and I realized this was
what I wanted to do...at least for a while. 

Classes and the academic theory were interesting to me but I couldn't resist the startup world.
Still, I found at that time a passion for education and curriculum. I became a tutor for several years
teaching CS fundamentals to freshman and sophomores. I also enjoyed helping
other classmates understand material having
myself entered college with 3 years of CS fundamentals and a 5 on the AP test
with the help and guidance of [Bob Franz](http://www.lasv.org/laaefamily/advisors/rfranz.htm).

I did various contracting jobs, explored multiple stacks and worked for several more startups including 
[quub](http://techcrunch.com/2009/04/27/quub-a-micromessaging-service-that-asks-what-are-you-doing-and-means-it/)
working with one of my top professors from college, 
[Don Patterson](http://www.ics.uci.edu/faculty/profiles/view_faculty.php?ucinetid=djpatter).

## Olepta

In college, I started a company with my good friend [Thomas Shafer](https://github.com/growlypants) 
named "Olepta", which was intended to be a turnkey scheduling solutions for health professionals. 
We worked on that together for several years while in college, including coordinating with our professors
to allow us to get formal school credit for our work and turn our company into our senior class project.
Had a great time with Olepta and we ended up getting multiple patents several of which 
were ultimately acquired by [Ethicon-Endo](http://www.ees.com/).

## Graduation and Open Source

My senior year (in 2008), I was working with my professor on a startup called 'quub', my own 
startup 'Olepta' and began falling in love with web development and working more seriously with Ruby. 
I started playing much more seriously with Rails and Sinatra and liking them both quite a bit. Started
focusing all of my time into that stack, opting to specialize rather than explore breadth-first
as I had been doing. Around this time, I decided to
[release](https://github.com/nesquena/wikipedia_search) a [few](https://github.com/nesquena/prototype_notifier)
[simple](https://github.com/nesquena/conditions_fu) [projects](https://github.com/nesquena/prototype_animator)
which sparked my interest in the open-source community.

## Post-graduation

In 2009, I graduated with a Bachelor's in "Informatics" from University of California at Irvine.
I also began working with a classmate [Arthur Chiu](https://github.com/achiu) and
started looking even closer at [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com), a ruby web micro-framework.
We began building tools for Sinatra to make web development easier and more powerful
and ultimately I released this open-source in a project called 
[sinatra-more](https://github.com/nesquena/sinatra_more). After a few months,
and multiple core contributors later, this turned into [Padrino](http://padrinorb.com/), 
the "godfather of Sinatra".

## In Closing

For the duration of my 4 years as an undergraduate, I was working in startups and contracting 
with near full-time hours. I worked in desktop development (Java, .NET),
mobile development (Blackberry, Symbian, Android) and a ton of web development (ASP.NET, Java, PHP and Ruby).
Always focused on building things and learning more about all the many, many things I didn't know. 

# My Professional History

The following is an incomplete list of a few highlights of my work history:

 * **iPodSoft** (2004) - Created my company to sell iPod-related software with other developers.
 * **Talking Panda** (2005-2007) - Worked intermittently as principal engineer on multiple iPod-related products available in Apple retail stores.
 * **Alturn Solutions** (2007-2009) - Worked intermittently to found this company with Thomas Shafer, building appointment scheduling for health professionals.
 * **quub** (2007-2010) - Worked as the principal engineer with founders to execute the vision for a passive, smart way to share your life with friends and family.

# My Skills

When I have been in a position to help grow the team in the startups I have worked at,
I always put a lot of emphasis on understanding how much visibility potential hires
had into the depths of their own knowledge. I consider people that rank themselves
too highly on any given skill a "red flag" of sorts. In my experience so far, there
are very few exceptions to the 
[Dunningâ€“Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).

I figure then that it would only be fair to rank my own abilities on a few key skills _as they stand today_. 
I am going for honesty here. An attempt to honestly evaluate my own skills (as hard as that can be).
The scale is from 1 (complete beginner, barely played with the skill) to 
10 (practical master, knows topic inside and out).
 
 * **Sinatra/Padrino**: 8
 * **Ruby**: 7
 * **Ruby on Rails**: 6
 * **API Development**: 6
 * **MiniTest** (unit tests): 6
 * **jQuery**: 6
 * **git**: 6
 * **Writing (documentation)**: 6
 * **Agile Process**: 5
